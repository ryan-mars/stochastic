# Our Methodology

A proposed methodology for building or updating line-of-business apps and services within large complex organizations. This should fit hand-in-glove with your digital transformation strategy.

Work in progress. Suggestions and criticism welcome.

### Orient Yourself to the Map

1. Re-affirm our shared mission, vision and values
2. Identify the general area of opportunity
3. Gather the right people
4. Collaboratively model the opportunity space with an appropriate level of abstraction
5. Verify shared understanding of the problems, opportunities, and potential value (cost of delay?)
6. Build agreement on the focus of immediate project efforts

### Immediate Actions (iterative)

1. Re-affirm our shared mission, vision and values
2. State the area of focus
3. Gather the right people
4. Collaboratively model the opportunity space with increasing levels of detail until software development can begin
5. Build
6. Deploy
7. Gather feedback
8. Repeat

## How to...

### Collaborative modeling tools

- "Big Picture" Event Storming
- "Process Model" Event Storming
- "Software Model" Event Storming
- Example Mapping

### Software design

1. Model the events, and flows (Software Model Event Storming)
2. Create a DAG of the events?
3. Map the business rules and illustrate with examples (Example Mapping)
4. Write acceptance tests in the shared language of the team
5. Design read models to satisfy queries, allow data requirements to flow up stream
6. Allow for eventual consistency
7. Implement policies and command handlers to pass the tests
