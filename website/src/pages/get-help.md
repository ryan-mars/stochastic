# Get Help from Event Storming Experts

We didn't [invent Event Storming](http://ziobrando.blogspot.com/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html) but we've grown to love it. We hope you do too.

Our vision is to make Event Storming as widely used as Agile/Scrum. 

Event Storming improves the lives of people involved in software projects. Event Storming also improves outcomes for organizations that use it. 

Widespread use of Event Storming will pave the way for [Stochastic](/docs/) adoption. Giving away some consulting to get Stochastic mainstreamed seems worthwhile to us.

This is why we train, coach, and mentor Event Storming facilitators and stakeholders like you.

Here are a few ways we can help you:

- Answer questions about Event Storming that are specific to your envrionment
- Determine if Event Storming is right for you
- Identify participants needed for a successful Event Storm
- Setting expectations, scope, and environment for success
- Provide an experienced facilitator so your first Event Storm is a success
- Train, coach, and mentor your people to facilitate Event Storming
