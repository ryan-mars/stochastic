# Who attends Event Storming

One of the most important decisions when preparing for Event Storming is who will attend. You need to strike the right balance between size of the group vs. having all the right participants. The goal is a reasonable sized group that includes all perspectives, organizational groups, and experts.

Don't try to make Event Storming work without that one "difficult" person. Include everyone that brings a valuable perspective, experience, or information.

Event Storming harnesses disagreement, different perspectives and ideas. This opens up space for discussing alternative approaches. These conversations also help everyone understand the motivation for the process. Everyone involved ends up on the same team, trying to achieve the best possible outcome.

## The types of people need at Event Storming

**Curious people** dig into areas outside their own, forcing others to explain things. These people will learn new things themselves, as will others that get to listen. This learning gives everyone a better understanding of the entire process.

**People that can answer questions** from every area of the process in question are key. It might take more than one person from some parts of the process to be able to answer all the questions. This is OK, because all participants will learn the answers given.

**People that know the right questions to ask** are also valuable. The most dangerous event at the beginning of a software project is a key question that is not asked. The cost of uncovering such questions later can be extreme.

**People that know the theory** are helpful when practice has diverged from the desired process. These people keep us within proper accounting practices, legal requirements, regulatory limitations, etc.

**People that know the current practice** are essential. People grounded in reality can drop truth bombs that surprise everyone else.

**People with influence in the organization** gain an understanding of the project realities. They become advocates for funding and staffing of the solution. Influence is not always due to rank, think of those that have influence above their job title. Creating an influence map is helpful in some situations.

## The roles needed at Event Storming

**Business people** and **users** with a vested interest in the process. Besides providing information, you want them bought into the process and the ultimate solution.

**IT managers**, **developers**, and **architects** that work on various parts of the solution. You need technical people to understand the business process. The better people understand why things are a particular way, the better the solution they create. Often, the "actual" steps of an existing process are hidden in the code. Technical people who work on those systems can inject some reality into conversations about "our current process".

**User Experience** experts that help build a better solution to automate the process. Like the technical implementation people, you want UX people to understand motivations so they create the best solution.

## Attendees change as the process unfolds

**Big Picture Event Storming** often includes extra people with influence across the organization. This is necessary to build trust in the process outside the immediate attendees. It also helps with funding, staffing, and any political cover needed.

**Process Modeling** may be a subset of the group in Big Picture. This smaller group focuses on a particular part of the process instead of the end-to-end view.

**Software Modeling** uses the same group as process modeling.
