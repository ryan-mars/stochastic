# When to Event Storm

Event Storming helps people learn together about a complex business process. Event storming is like any tool, it works best in specific situations. Here's a list of some situations where Event Storming is helpful.

## **When scattered process knowledge is a problem**

Event Storming brings experts together to learn the end-to-end process from each other.

The experts create a visual map of the process together. The map includes everyone's perspective and knowledge. This visual map supports training, cross-group collaboration, and process improvement conversations.

## **When collaboration across silos is difficult**

Event Storming brings people together from across the organization in a new way.  Learning from one another about the process changes the dynamic. People sense this change and get immersed in solving problems together.

We often see narratives change from *us-vs-them* to *how-do-WE-solve-this*.

## **When starting a large initiative or software project**

Event Storming starts by clarifying and visualizing the business process. It also reveals hidden information and possibilities by looking at many perspectives.

With the business process and pain points visible, political consensus is almost automatic. This is a huge value at the beginning of a large software project.

## **When a large software project runs into problems**

When a large project runs into problems, a reset is sometimes needed.

Event storming clarifies and visualizes the business process and key problem areas. This clarity allows for easy alignment to solve the right problem.

In these situations, there may be many issues at play, so experienced facilitation is helpful.

## **When creating a new process or value stream**

Event Storming begins by creating shared understanding and a visual of the business process. The visual supports discussion of the process and how various parts will work together.

Event Storming Process Modeling provides a thorough examination of process alternatives. This allows the experts to craft a solid process from the beginning.

An Event Storm aligns everyone to create the right process and the right solution.

## **When everyone feels stuck in a legacy system**

It can feel overwhelming when stuck in a legacy system. Often, there's a large backlog of major change requests, each of which is daunting. Some are calling for a rewrite of the entire system, but that cure may seem worse than the disease.

Event Storming brings experts together to learn from one another about the process. These experts create a visual showing the entire process, opportunities, and challenges. The experts identify the single biggest problem to solve first.

Event Storming provides the clarity, consensus and political will needed to solve big problems.

## **When subject matter experts are too busy to contribute**

Critical subject matter experts are usually working at full capacity. Their time is valuable so you need to convince them there is a payback for their time.

Here are a few things they get by attending:

- insight into parts of the process they may not know well;
- a visual to help explain their perspective and the process to others;
- an opportunity to expose and resolve persistent issues anywhere in the process.

These are strong motivations for subject matter experts to make time for an Event Storm.
