# What is Event Storming?

## Overview

<!-- ![Event%20Storming%20Section%20Welcome%20Start%20Page%203216ca7d21744b3687d644df0820e3ba/IMG_1445_2.jpeg](Event%20Storming%20Section%20Welcome%20Start%20Page%203216ca7d21744b3687d644df0820e3ba/IMG_1445_2.jpeg) -->

**Event Storming is a workshop where business + tech come together to understand requirements and design a system.** Event Storming reduces months of back-and-forth communication into three days or less. After decades of agile coaching we've found Event Storming to be the best way to get everyone on the same page. **Event Storming is great for "Sprint Zero"** and it works equally well for documenting new or existing systems.

> ** ðŸ’¡ Event Storming helps everyone learn about the business, align around the same goal, and design software for it.**

When we do Event Storming we include experts across business and technology. Notation is simple and flexible, using sticky notes ([or the remote equivalent](how/remote)). It's easy for everyone to take part and learn Event Storming as-they-go. With a little practice you can easily become an Event Storming facilitator. This is a great way to increase your individual impact. [We'd love to help you with your first Event Storming and show you how to facilitate it yourself.](/get-help)

**After Event Storming your team will have:**

1. A **common understanding** and language for the business across roles, silos and specialties.
2. **Political consensus** and will to solve the biggest, most pressing problem.
3. A **detailed map** of the business processes for software design, creation and maintenance.

> ðŸ’¡ Event Storming gives you a **road map**, **alignment** from deep understanding and the **political will** necessary for a successful software project. **No other discovery method systematically creates these three cornerstones.** Only Event Storming gets it done **on the first day**.

## How Does Event Storming Work?

Event Storming happens over three sessions, ideally one day each. With each session we gather the right people have the important conversations that need to happen. You can think of these as phases of the learning and design process to create software. Conversations are prompted by thought provoking questions from a facilitator, and our shared understanding is captured on the wall (or online white-board) using a simple notation of different colored sticky notes.

- Day 1 paints the [**"Big Picture"**](#big-picture). Everyone comes away with a shared understanding of the business need, existing systems, and consensus around the most pressing issue.
- Day 2 dives deeply into the area with the most will for action in [**"Process Modeling"**](#process-modeling)
- Day 3 focuses on [**"Software Modeling"**](#software-modeling) as developers and testers prepare to implement the process model in software. They are supported by business experts, who answer questions as they arise.

[After Event Storming](after) you are ready to begin building your backlog and planning your sprints.

**You can easily facilitate these sessions yourself. We're here to help. [Schedule a free Q&A with us before doing it yourself, or have us facilitate it for you](/get-help).**

## Day 1: Big Picture {#big-picture}

First **Big Picture Event Storming** gives everyone a common high level understanding of the system. We invite business and technical people from across the domain in question.

![Big Picture Event Storming](/img/event-storming-big-picture-1.png)

Participants collaboratively assemble an end-to-end timeline of important events, policies, external systems and roles involved in the business process.

Hot button issues and questions that cannot be answered by those present are noted and resolution is deferred.

Opportunities are noted and finally an exercise of "arrow voting" reveals the areas with the most political consensus for action.

## Day 2: Process Modeling {#process-modeling}

NEED AN ILLUSTRATION

Next, **Process Modeling** dives deeply into the area with the most will for action. We examine this area of the business process in detail and collaborate to refine it as we go.

Participants examine the flows of information, identify policies, and walk through multiple scenarios enforcing process consistency.

Process Modeling examines sources of value and motivation of the system. Participants make their hard choices visible.

## Day 3: Software Modeling {#software-modeling}

NEED AN ILLUSTRATION

Finally, in **Software Modeling**, technical people focus on design as they prepare to implement the process in software.

## Event Storming runs in cycles

**Big Picture** Event Storming is a great way to kickoff a big software project. This part includes leaders from across business and technology. Big Picture Event Storming creates an end-to-end shared understanding of the business process. The problem or bottleneck to solve first is obvious by the end of Big Picture.

**Process Modeling** is a deep dive into a specific area, starting with the first problem to solve. Business experts and technology people work together to evaluate alternatives, define and refine the process.

**Software Modeling** is when technical people design software to automate the agreed on business process.

Once the first big problem is solved, the leaders from across business and technology reconvene. In this session they might discuss the results, review the Big Picture visualization and select the next problem to solve.

The cycle of Big Picture, Process Modeling, and Software Modeling continues. Long term it moves from solving huge problems to quickly adjusting to changes in the business environment.

## What is Event Storming like?

From the beginning, people realize Event Storming is a different kind of experience. Event Storming is fun, it's collaboration like most people have never seen before.

People participating learn from one another about the business process. Real challenges are discussed and hard choices are made.

> ðŸ’¡ Participants gain a larger perspective of the organization and how their work fits in. Challenges faced across the organization become visible, which builds empathy between people that barely knew one another hours before. This empathy improves cross silo collaboration and decision making.

New relationships are formed and old ones are strengthened. Teams are brought together by the people involved.

The experience is of a group learning and problem solving exercise, where political divisions and turf wars melt away.

A successful software project starts this way. People across the organization have the same understanding and goals. Everyone supports the hard decisions because they participated and understand the trade-offs that led to those decisions.

## How do I talk to colleagues about Event Storming?

When introducing change to an organization, one needs to explain **w**hat's **i**n **i**t **f**or **m**e (WIIFM) to a lot of people. While this is beyond the scope of this page, we wrote [Why Event Storm](why) to give you the various benefits to share with key decision makers in your organization.

> ðŸ’¡ We recommend thinking through things from the perspective of the various decision makers and in some cases even creating an influence map to drive these conversations.
