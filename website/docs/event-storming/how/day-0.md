## How Do I Facilitate Event Storming for my Project?

3. Set scope of your workshop
4. Identify key decision makers and influencers
5. Identify key experts (business and technology)
6. Decide face-to-face vs remote
7. Schedule the day
8. If face-to-face:
   1. Order your supplies
   2. Reserve a suitable space
9. If remote:
   1. Get Miro (or similar) licenses for all participants
   2. Study Remote Event Storming article
