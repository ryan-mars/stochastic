# Why Use Event Storming?

You may be skeptical about Event Storming, or perhaps you need to convince others in your organization to give it a try.

This article dives deeper into the benefits of Event Storming. Each item's importance and weight will depend on your organization and the particular challenges you face. 

To enroll others in Event Storming, share the items most impactful to their needs.

### Learning the business is the real bottleneck

Knowledge is scattered across your organization. Wood's Law shows us the depth of the problem.

> In a complex system, everyone's mental model is incomplete and out of date and everyone's model is incomplete and out of date in different ways.
>
> â€” [David D. Woods](https://ise.osu.edu/people/woods.2)

All software projects start with knowledge gathering. In traditional projects, knowledge is often gathered by a single individual. This person's task is to gather knowledge scattered around the organization and put it in one place: a requirements document.

This process creates a learning bottleneck, because all required knowledge must pass through one person to be placed in one document.

While we believe that having "a single source of truth" will help us, there are several problems.

First, trying to understand a complex problem by piecewise analysis is difficult. It's often impossible. People working in this situation are heroic to complete any software projects.

It takes time to meet with all the right people and synthesize their input. More time goes into finding conflicts and circling back to resolve them. 

Writing and reviewing the requirements document takes even more time. Everyone agrees that the document makes sense because each reads ***in*** their understanding.

> ðŸ’¡ Developers are forced read their own unique understanding into documents, expecially when they have little or no business knowledge. This is why it's so effective to include developers in the learning and discovery process. This is how you minimize the learning bottleneck.

### Learn together so everyone has the same understanding

Building the wrong thing is the biggest risk in software projects. It's a significant source of waste on successful projects and the cause of failure for many.

Agile attacks this risk with ongoing user involvement and regular feedback. Unfortunately, the users that understand the system are too busy to participate. 

Those made available to Agile teams often have narrow business expertise and no decision authority. Thus teams struggle to get time with overworked subject matter experts.

People chosen to represent the customer become the new learning bottleneck.

This can be deadly for teams new to a business domain, as they must learn while implementing. They start out behind the curve and learn the business as the project ends.

> ðŸ’¡ Event Storming with key business and technical people removes the learning bottleneck. It allows everyone to learn together and create a visual map of the business process.

Event Storming participants learn more from each other than they could learn on their own. The improved understanding and alignment across silos is often the most astonishing outcome.

Everyone sees the same big picture view. Experts can dive into their area of specialization with a fresh perspective.

Developers gain a clarity of understanding from these conversations that seemed impossible before. This reduces waste, frustration and time to value.

Developers also meet the business experts, building relationships and empathy. Developer work transforms when writing software for a person instead of a requirements document or user story. 

This adds meaning, motivation and satisfaction to technical work.

Business experts gain a strategic view of the entire process. This allows them to look beyond narrow self interests and find synergy with others. Decisions are better because everyone understands the tradeoffs and examines them together.

> ðŸ’¡ Creating this synergy and alignment was a haphazard process left to visionary leaders wiht magical social skills. Event Storming creates this through collaboration, clarity and a bit of social engineering.

### Create consensus and political will for change

A key outcome of Event Storming is political consensus and the will to solve hard problems.

Imagine the scene: all the key stakeholders and experts are in the same room. For the first time the end-to-end process is visible to them. 

All questions, alternatives, disagreements and areas of suspicious complexity are visible "hot spots."

The topics of value creation, value loss and opportunity have been examined in a structured manner.

Everyone understands the business more deeply than they did a few hours earlier.

Then the question: "What is the most important issue to attack first?"

Those present have a shared understanding of the process, the value it creates and motivation behind various trade-offs. They also have more empathy for the problems faced by one other.

> ðŸ’¡ In this state of mind, difficult decisions become easy. The entire group votes and the alignment surprises many. You need this kind of political buy-in and support to solve tough problems.

Once you solve that first, tough problem, everything gets easier.

Best part is that this happens in a single day. Your project *starts* on the fast track to success.

### Event Storming shows value and builds trust from the very start

Traditional software projects took months or years to show value. Agile methods can begin to show value in weeks. 

Event storming shows value within hours.

Participants learn from a structured conversation about the key events in the business process. People learn about processes and motivations they missed for years within the first couple of hours.

They learn reasons for policies that formerly seemed silly. They gain an appreciation for work in other parts of the organization and a deeper appreciation for their own. They understand the why behind so many instances of "because that's the way we do it around here."

They also question long held assumptions. They see festering problems for the first time. They see new opportunities to deliver value.

> ðŸ’¡ This deeper understanding and reexamination of assumptions is of obvious value to everyone in the room.

This new understanding and perspective gets translated directly into improved processes and software. Everyone in the room can see it coming long before software is created.

### Refine outdated processes before committing them to code

New system designs often take existing processes as a given. The user experience improves and obvious process pain points get addressed. 

It's rare for all processes to get completely reexamined before a major rewrite. Even changed or new processes may not get a rigorous examination by the relevant experts.

This is a missed opportunity. Given typical system life spans, this commits the organization to outdated processes for years.

> ðŸ’¡ Event Storming reexamines existing processes in depth. Business and technical experts work together through various scenarios, exploring value and motivation. They examine multiple options and make a deliberate choice based on ROI.

This deep examination of the process and trade-offs between various options builds a level of expertise and confidence that is rare in software development.

### Event Storming changes people and how they think about work

Most development teams never meet with the users of their software. They create a notion of what the customer wants and why they want it from second hand clues.

The users rarely get to deeply examine and reimagine how their work is done. They never even think of the possibility that software could change to better meet their needs. At least not outside of a passing fantasy.

When users and developers attend Event Storming, the experience is novel and refreshing. They come to understand the challenges faced by peers in other parts of the organization. Together, they form an end-to-end understanding of the business and represent it visually. 

They experience a camaraderie built from learning together with peers across the organization.

> ðŸ’¡ Many gain fresh perspectives and ideas about their work. For the first time, some see a path to solving entrenched, difficult problems. Many learn how their work contributes to something larger and more meaningful.

People remember these experiences and appreciate those that make them happen. They believe in and support the work that follows.
