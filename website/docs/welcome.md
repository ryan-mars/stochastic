# Welcome to Stochastic

Stochastic has an ambitious goal: to change the way Digital Enterprises create software.

The digital revolution is accelerating, impacting more businesses than ever. Many of these businesses are struggling to adapt to the new digital norm.

**Old tools, processes and architecture can't move at the pace of digital.** Organizations that find themselves behind the digital change curve are ill equipped to change their foundation.

**Stochastic offers a fresh start, attacking problems across the entire software life cycle:**

- A clear **understanding of the problem** to solve across business and technology
- A **visual map of the problem domain** useful for collaboration on changes and training
- Extensive **review of processes** and options before committing to code
- A **modern architecture** that scales at the speed of digital business
- **Collaborative software design** cross trains developers and improves software
- Artifacts that enable **test automation** and insure **shared understanding**
- **Developer and stakeholder wellbeing** is considered from start to finish

The first challenge of enterprise software development is understanding the problem that needs solving: What is the software supposed to do? We start with **Event Storming. Collaborative learning is the best way for everyone involved to understand** and agree on the problem to be solved. Event Storming aligns everyone with a visual of the business need before software work starts.

Event Storming includes **Process Modeling** for a thorough review of processes. This **process examination before committing to code** results in better understanding and better software. 

We add **Example Mapping and other practices** to enhance understanding and enable Behavior Driven Development.

Event Storming includes **Software Modeling**, an intuitive design by color approach to software. This makes **Domain Driven Design** available to a wider audience.

Modern architecture and design lead to **scalable, easy to change systems**. Stochastic adopts **Event Sourcing** and several other architecture patterns to provide a solid foundation.

The Stochastic framework makes development of Event Sourced systems possible for a wider audience. Stochastic uses the output of Event Storming to create the basis of your application. 

Stochastic leverages **Serverless Computing so you can focus on the application instead of infrastructure**. Your solution is scalable by default.

Stochastic sets up developers to follow good development practices. **Behavior Driven Development and Automated Unit Testings** tools are available to the developer by default. 

The names in the code come from the business domain. The code correlates to the Event Storming visual maps so conversations about progress, how things work and potential changes are easier.

Our goal is ambitious, to change how software for the digital enterprise is written. On this journey, there are places for **Event Storming facilitators, trainers, developers, architects, technical writers, and more.** Contact us via social accounts below to **get involved.**
