# Overview

The Distributed Systems section is for architects and experienced developers who are considering the availability and performance benefits of distributed systems but are inexperienced in the implementation thereof. They may feel the subject intimidating or out of reach.

This section should provide the reader with:

- An overview of the tradeoffs and benefits of distributed systems
- A lay persons introduction to the principles they should know off-hand when designing such systems
- An overview of key solutions to distributed systems problems (relative to stochastic)
- The benefits of serverless

The reader should walk away with a general overview of the benefits and hard parts of distributed systems. They should be able to reason about how stochastic **might** work under the hood.
