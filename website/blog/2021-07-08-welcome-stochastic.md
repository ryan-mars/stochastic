We are developing Stochastic in public. Our goal is to change how enterprise software is created, from
problem definition through design, infrastracture creation, coding and deployment.

Problems Stochastic is attacking:
1. Without a coherent understanding of the problem to be solved software projects deteriorate into wasted effort, frustration and lost opportunity.
2. Widely understood architectural patterns do not take full advantage of the cloud. Emerging event sourced, cloud native architectural patterns are not widely know.
3. Software projects focus on creating software quickly, sacrificing long term quality, adaptability, technical excellence and automation.
4. Developer tooling and frameworks often feel like a patch work, resulting in developer fatigue and inconsistencies within and across applications.

We believe the problems above:
- Put software projects on a path to misadventure
- Cause immense human suffering on development teams
- Hamper growth and prosperity of businesses
- Are solvable with current technology
- Are best solved by a distributed, open source community
- Represent a tremendous opportunity for early adopters

We are currently looking for early feedback from developers.
