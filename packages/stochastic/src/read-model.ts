// I think we're overloading the ReadModel concept with a Query... which I left out
// A query handler should be a lambda

// we need to reduce Events to State, and then query State ?
// Why not just feed them the events and give them a client for their DB of choice and let the dev sort it out
// I don't know State is always going to be so clean unless you have a clever approach
// I would say State is more general, "doing what you want with a DB", is `State<void>` or `State<any>`?
// Ok go for it
// LOL i dunno
// Neither do I right now I'm using dynamodb-toolbox to create a Model for each read model and I update or query those models (just an abstraction over the document client)  but I don't want to recreate an ORM
// The other thing is, read models are going to be varied how to do you give the dev the freedom to implement using whatever abstraction they want?
// Override a `save` function?
// ok cool
// we only need this if we care about the type of state elsewhere. like in GraphQL...
// Let's go for it but do we want to call it state or Model? üëç
// what was wrong with ReadModel? It's a model that can be read? Should it have multiple interfaces, maybe?
// I think we're down a rabbit hole right now
// Let's roll back up to commands
