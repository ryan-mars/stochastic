# Scheduling

The Scheduling Dept. is responsible for:

- defining the routes (airport to airport) the airline will fly
- the occurence of those flights (days and times)
- aircraft assigned to each flight (type and tail number)

Scheduling shares this information through events for announcement of:

- New routes
- The route schedule for a given period of time
- Schedule changes
