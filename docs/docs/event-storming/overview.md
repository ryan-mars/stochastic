# Overview

The Event Storming section should provide the reader with:

- an overview of Event Storming suitable for the unfamiliar
  - what it is
  - who it is for
  - when to use it
  - key benefits
- a break down of each "phase" of event storming
- detailed instructions for how to conduct each workshop
- tips and tricks

The reader should feel well introduced to the topic, even though they may not feel confident enough to conduct it themselves.
